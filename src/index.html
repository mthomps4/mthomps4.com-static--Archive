                I enjoy the simple things in life. I’m a husband, father, teacher,
                mentor, and craftsman. I’m able to invest in these areas of life by
                working and evolving as a Software Engineer and Consultant. I believe in
                paying it forward. My success is defined by those who invested in me and
                how much I invest back into others. While we all have pressing deadlines
                and stress, I’m fulfilled knowing I’ve set others up to succeed. I
                didn’t get here alone and neither will you. The world is a better place
                when we set our pride aside and work together. How can I help?

          … a Husband My partner in this adventure called life. Emily and I met at
          Georgetown College, and married soon after in May of 2011 settling down in
          her home town Louisville, KY. We are a dynamic duo, Yin and Yang,
          continuing to support one another at every turn.

          … a Father 2019 brought us this “all or nothing” ball of energy. He’s
          always happy and excited to see people. This kid brings full perspective
          to my day-to-day, keeping me grounded with his smiles. I live for my
          family.

          … a Woodworker and Craftsman I spend more time playing with my boy than at
          my workbench; however, I still love to build and have always been
          mesmerized by joinery and timber framing. Thanks to companies like Lost
          Art Press, I started a mini library on traditional woodworking,
          hand-tools, and Japanese joinery. I also started restoring and building my
          own tools as I go.

          … a Teacher and Mentor I believe in paying it forward. My success is
          defined by those who invested in me and how much I invest back into
          others. While we all have pressing deadlines and stress, I’m fulfilled
          knowing I’ve set others up to succeed. I’ve volunteered as a code camp
          instructor, taught 1:1 sessions, co-run a local meetup, contribute as a
          content creator, and have recently started dumping my learning and
          recordings here on my blog. If I’m able to help, I will.

          … an Engineer and Consultant At some point you need to make money to
          support all the other facets of life. I am fortunate to be doing this as
          an Engineer and Consultant for software development company called
          Echobind. A remote agency with similar core values around being a good
          human being. Echobind has allowed me to invest in myself and my team. More
          importantly Echobind recognizes the value of work life balance, being 100%
          remote allows more time for family and smiles. How can we help?
