    … a Husband My partner in this adventure called life. Emily and I met at
    Georgetown College, and married soon after in May of 2011 settling down in
    her home town Louisville, KY. We are a dynamic duo, Yin and Yang,
    continuing to support one another at every turn.

    … a Father 2019 brought us this “all or nothing” ball of energy. He’s
    always happy and excited to see people. This kid brings full perspective
    to my day-to-day, keeping me grounded with his smiles. I live for my
    family.

    … a Woodworker and Craftsman I spend more time playing with my boy than at
    my workbench; however, I still love to build and have always been
    mesmerized by joinery and timber framing. Thanks to companies like Lost
    Art Press, I started a mini library on traditional woodworking,
    hand-tools, and Japanese joinery. I also started restoring and building my
    own tools as I go.

    … a Teacher and Mentor I believe in paying it forward. My success is
    defined by those who invested in me and how much I invest back into
    others. While we all have pressing deadlines and stress, I’m fulfilled
    knowing I’ve set others up to succeed. I’ve volunteered as a code camp
    instructor, taught 1:1 sessions, co-run a local meetup, contribute as a
    content creator, and have recently started dumping my learning and
    recordings here on my blog. If I’m able to help, I will.

    … an Engineer and Consultant At some point you need to make money to
    support all the other facets of life. I am fortunate to be doing this as
    an Engineer and Consultant for software development company called
    Echobind. A remote agency with similar core values around being a good
    human being. Echobind has allowed me to invest in myself and my team. More
    importantly Echobind recognizes the value of work life balance, being 100%
    remote allows more time for family and smiles. How can we help?

      I enjoy the simple things in life. I’m a husband, father, teacher,
      mentor, and craftsman. I’m able to invest in these areas of life by
      working and evolving as a Software Engineer and Consultant. I believe in
      paying it forward. My success is defined by those who invested in me and
      how much I invest back into others. While we all have pressing deadlines
      and stress, I’m fulfilled knowing I’ve set others up to succeed. I
      didn’t get here alone and neither will you. The world is a better place
      when we set our pride aside and work together. How can I help?
